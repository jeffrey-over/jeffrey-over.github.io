---
Just like last year, an overview of my year in the field of marketing automation, web, and e-mail development. A year in which I adjusted my personal website a number of times and eventually opted for a minimalistic appearance.

In addition, I have developed a number of internal projects at DM-Interface that have ensured that we can provide our customers with better and more consistent work. I also started with a Javascript training and I set up an open-source SASS framework.

### What I learned in 2018
- Javascript
- Customer Journeys
- Smarty
- Clang E-mail Software
- Customizing Wordpress
- Modular (SASS)
