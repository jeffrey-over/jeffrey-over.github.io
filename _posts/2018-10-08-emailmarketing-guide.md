There is no fixed framework that ensures that every journey is successful. Every customer is different. To set up a successful customer journey you will have to deliver real added value and find a cycle to measure, test, and adjust non-stop. However, there are several methods that can be used to help you with this.

### Cinemagraphs
Have you ever seen those GIFs where only a small portion of the photo animates subtly? That's a cinemagraph!

They first took to the skies in 2011 and are increasingly being deployed. Because of the subtle animation it feels calm and elegant. That is why they are regularly included in social Ads campaigns.

If you want to use them yourself, you can find a large collection on [Giphy](https://giphy.com/explore/cinemagraphs).

### Chunking
How much can you remember at one time before you forget something? Is it better to remember a phone number as one long series or is it better with intermediate steps?

Cognitive scientists have determined that the most we can remember from a list of unknown items are between 5 and 9 items. Or, about 2 seconds to what we can repeat, out loud or to ourselves.

Responding to this is called 'chunking'. With an e-mail you can apply this by placing content in clear sections.

### Churn Rate
The Customer Churn Rate indicates how many subscribers were canceled in a given period. So the number of cancellations.

### Curiosity Marketing
Curiosity Marketing is exactly what you think! Try to make recipients curious so they can learn more about the subject.
Write your email in such a way that it stops at the climax, the curiosity is aroused just enough that they want to click through to see the sequel. Watch out that it will not be [clickbaiting](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickbait).


### Gaze Cueing
Research has shown that we are automatically attracted to faces and lines. These studies have shown that more than 55% of the information that is transferred during a face-to-face conversation depends on visual contact. When an image is placed on a website or advertisement, it is smart to let the model look at the most important call to action.

I personally prefer to apply gaze cueing more subtly and to clarify the path between the different elements in an email or website with lines or arrows.

Gaze Cueing pairs well with Chunking. For example, after each section or article in your mail you can show an arrow next to some white space that 'points' to the next article.

### Guerilla Marketing
Guerilla marketing is actually more of a method where you can still get attention with a low budget on your product, for example with fun actions trying to go viral.

### Priming
We unconsciously link images with a certain association. By cleverly applying this neuro technique in your campaigns, you can stimulate and trigger this association to convert. For example, if you see something yellow, you will think of a banana faster.

### Snackable content
Or bite-sized content. Short and sweet. Content that is quick and easy to view is also called snackable content. This strategy is especially valuable when your customer is on mobile. On your mobile you are often not waiting for long texts of 2,000 / 3,000, but you just want something accessible.
Use it to engage or get more traffic to your great content. Above all, try to work with relevant images.

### Storytelling
Storytelling works by conveying one story and making the other think. Let the reader of your email or article hang on your lip instead of statically and formally describing your product.
