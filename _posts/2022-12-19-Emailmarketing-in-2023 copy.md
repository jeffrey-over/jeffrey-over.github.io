As we head into 2023, email marketing remains a crucial part of any digital marketing strategy. Here are five things you need to know about email marketing in 2023:

1. Open rates are still hovering around 20%: Recent data shows that the average open rate for marketing emails is around 20%. This means that about 20% of the people who receive your email will actually open it. While this may not seem like a high number, it's important to remember that email is still one of the most effective marketing channels out there.
1. Click-through rates are around 3%: In addition to open rates, it's also important to pay attention to click-through rates, which measure how many people who opened your email actually clicked on a link. The average click-through rate for marketing emails is around 3%.
1. Mobile is king: More and more people are accessing their emails on their mobile devices, with around 60% of emails being opened on a mobile device. This means that it's crucial to make sure your emails are mobile-responsive and easy to read on smaller screens.
1. Personalization is key: Personalized emails tend to have higher open and click-through rates compared to non-personalized emails. Make sure to use the data you have about your subscribers to create targeted, relevant emails that will capture their attention.
1. Analytics are your friend: To really understand what's working and what's not with your email marketing, you need to track and analyze your email metrics. Look at open rates, click-through rates, and other key metrics to see how your emails are performing and make adjustments as needed.

By keeping these five things in mind, you can create effective email marketing campaigns that will help you reach your business goals in 2023. Happy emailing!
