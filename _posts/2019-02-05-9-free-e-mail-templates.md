For all marketers and developers who need a litmus-proof template quickly. Here are some free email templates that have been tested in popular clients. Many of these templates are managed by a permanent community or specialized team. This means they are regularly updated with updates!

### Conclusion
My personal preference is Cerberus. Cerberus forms a solid foundation with the most commonly used sections.

I have also used this email as a basis when developing a master template that is completely litmus-proof. The modular design of this master template makes it easy to expand. It is therefore also possible to use dynamic content so that you can send the right message to the right person at the right time. The three pillars for relevant content.
