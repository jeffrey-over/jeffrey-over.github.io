Has your Marigold Engage campaign come to a halt? Don't worry, it's a common issue that can usually be fixed with a few simple troubleshooting steps. Here's what to do when your Marigold Engage campaign isn't starting:

1. Check if the campaign is activated. Some campaigns may be paused or disabled, which can prevent the campaign from starting.
1. Check if the campaign has a valid start and end date. If the campaign's start date is in the future, it won't start until that date. If the campaign's end date is in the past, it also won't start.
1. Check if the campaign is linked to a valid segmentation. If the campaign is targeting an empty segment, it won't start.
1. Check if the campaign is linked to a valid channel. If the channel is not available or not properly configured, the campaign won't start.
1. Check for any error messages that may have occurred during the campaign start. Some errors can prevent the campaign from starting.


By following these troubleshooting tips, you should be able to get your Marigold Engage campaign up and running in no time.
