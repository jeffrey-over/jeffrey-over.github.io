### Helder
Helder is a CSS framework that aims to provide a no-fuss, minimalist approach to styling web projects. It includes components such as forms, cards, and tables, and ensures that they are consistently styled across different browsers. One of the benefits of using Helder is its small size, weighing in at only 11.3 KB. This makes it a lightweight alternative to other, more feature-heavy frameworks that may include unnecessary code. Instead, Helder focuses on providing a simple grid system and stylish, yet minimalistic components, so that you can focus on building your project without getting bogged down in unnecessary details.

| Framework        | Size           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| <span style="color:green">**Helder**</span>| <span style="color:green">**11 KB**</span> | 
| Bootstrap| 187 KB     | 
| Foundation| 90 KB      | 
| Materialize| 114 KB      | 


The [documentation](https://www.jeffreyovermeer.com/helder-css-framework/) describes how you can start with Helder, which components have been styled and how you can use this.

Helder comes with a variety of pre-styled components that you can use on your website, including buttons, forms, tables, and more. You can view a list of these components and see how they look by visiting the "View components" link above.

To use a component, simply include the appropriate HTML markup in your project and apply the appropriate class names to your elements. For example, to create a button using Helder, you would use the following HTML:

<pre>&lt;button class="btn"&gt;Click me!&lt;/button&gt;</pre>

### SASS
If you want to customize the appearance of your Helder-based website further, you can use the provided SASS variables to change the values of various styling properties. This allows you to easily adjust the colors, fonts, and other aspects of the framework to better match your own design preferences.

We hope that you find Helder helpful in creating beautiful and functional websites! If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out.
