### CSS framework
A CSS framework is a collection of CSS files used for web projects to save time styling components, structuring layouts, and providing **cross-browser compatibility**. It can be a nightmare without a CSS framework to style a component that works well and the same in all browsers.

In my opinion, the most popular frameworks have become so large that they also bring a lot of noise. You simply don't use a lot of code. You have to make sure that it takes more time to find out all the possibilities of a framework than to take care of the CSS yourself.

### Helder
Helder is a compact CSS framework that, with a simple grid system and minimalist design, provides for the structure of layouts and consistently styled components and leaves out the superfluous. This makes Helder with only 11.3 KB a real lightweight:

| Framework        | Size           | 
| ------------- |:-------------:| 
| <span style="color:green">**Helder**</span>| <span style="color:green">**11 KB**</span> | 
| Bootstrap| 187 KB     | 
| Foundation| 90 KB      | 
| Materialize| 114 KB      | 


The [documentation](https://www.jeffreyovermeer.com/helder-css-framework/) describes how you can start with Helder, which components have been styled and how you can use this.

### SASS
Helder is also available in SASS. If you are familiar with SASS, I recommend using this option to make it even easier to adjust Helder to your own preferences.
